# Serde Protobuf

`serde-protobuf` is a [`serde`] protobuf data format with first class support for reflection.

This library is meant for academic purposes. It's primary feature is a full write up of my journey
through rust and creating this library. While correctness is important, do not expect production
level maturity. Speed and benchmarking are important too, but only to the point of quenching
curiosity.

## Motivation

There are already protobuf implementations out in the wild, most notably [`prost`], the library
powering [`tonic`]. Why make another?

At some point, to get a better grasp of rust, I felt the need to work on a project. I took personal
interest in [`protobuf`] and [`gRPC`]. In particular, I wanted to try making a server that 
supports the [`transcoding`] `google.api.http` annotation.

```protobuf
// transcode between HTTP GET /v1/shelves/{shelf} and GetShelf gRPC 
// where the field shelf in GetShelfRequest maps to {shelf} in the URI. 
// Note: All protobuf messages have a JSON representation too.
rpc GetShelf(GetShelfRequest) returns (GetShelfResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/shelves/{shelf}" };
}

message GetShelfRequest {
  int64 shelf = 1;
}
```

With this option, gRPC servers could effortlessly add a analog HTTP/JSON interface to their API.
This is especially important for public facing servers since HTTP/JSON is so widespread.

Feeling stoked, I investigated what it would take to support it. What a rabbit hole that turned out
to be! The annotation is a custom option. Custom options are `proto2` extensions that require
working with descriptors. Working with descriptors involves reflection. Not to mention there is a
standard JSON wire format that needs to be supported too. This one little line  ended up traversing
much of the protobuf feature set.

Browsing the rust protobuf ecosystem, I felt that reflection was a critical missing piece of
functionality. In addition to reflection, I felt libraries like prost were missing the distinctive
rust flavor that serde provides. To me, it feels wrong to write a serialization library that does
not support `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`. And while some libraries did support serde, it
still felt unnatural because each type had their own custom serialization instead of coming up with
a data format.

## Implementation

What follows is my documented experience writing this library. Please note that this is a learning
process. I started this project right after reading [`The Rust Book`]. 

###  Reflection primer

To a user, reflection is a standardized way to [`describe`] and manipulate any arbitrary object
generated by the protobuf compiler. Any valid `.proto` file can be translated into a
`FileDescriptorProto` protobuf message and back without losing any information. Even comments are
preserved. It is possible to write a common interface that can validate, manipulate, extend, or even
dynamically create any message object from its descriptor. 

Of particular interest is the ability for third parties to extend messages with additional fields.
For example, custom options, like the `google.api.http` annotation, can be created by adding an
extension to `google.protobuf.MessageOptions`. 

For myself, the developer of this library, I would like to to create a protobuf compiler plugin that
is capable of generating these descriptors in rust as well as a way for the generated types to
access their associated descriptor. The generated code can then plug into my reflection library and
its done! Piece of cake right? Right... Let's begin.

### Deep dive into `protobuf-go`

Since other protobuf languages have already added reflection, lets use them as an example. After a
little digging, I found [`protobuf-go`], a brand new library implemented in a compiled language with
clear thought put into the reflection interface. It was clear that this interface would be the
standard to base my own interface after.

A brief glance at the source code made it abundantly clear that my life was not going to be easy if
I tried to port the Go implementation to Rust. Lets look at an example:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message Simple {
    bool simple_bool = 1;
}
```

Running the `.proto` through the Go protobuf plugin produces the struct:

```go
type Simple struct {
	state         protoimpl.MessageState
	sizeCache     protoimpl.SizeCache
	unknownFields protoimpl.UnknownFields

	SimpleBool bool
}
```

`SimpleBool` is public data, the rest is private reflection state. `state` is interesting in
particular because it contains a single pointer:

```go
type MessageState struct {
	atomicMessageInfo *MessageInfo
}
```

And it happens to always be the first field in the struct. This is not by coincidence. To access the
reflection interface, users call `ProtoReflect`. Here is the implementation:

```go
var file_simple_proto_msgTypes = make([]protoimpl.MessageInfo, 1)

func (x *Simple) ProtoReflect() protoreflect.Message {
	mi := &file_simple_proto_msgTypes[0]
	if protoimpl.UnsafeEnabled && x != nil {
		ms := protoimpl.X.MessageStateOf(protoimpl.Pointer(x))
		if ms.LoadMessageInfo() == nil {
			ms.StoreMessageInfo(mi)
		}
		return ms
	}
	return mi.MessageOf(x)
}

func (ms *messageState) LoadMessageInfo() *MessageInfo {
	return (*MessageInfo)(atomic.LoadPointer((*unsafe.Pointer)(unsafe.Pointer(&ms.atomicMessageInfo))))
}

func (ms *messageState) StoreMessageInfo(mi *MessageInfo) {
	atomic.StorePointer((*unsafe.Pointer)(unsafe.Pointer(&ms.atomicMessageInfo)), unsafe.Pointer(mi))
}
```

Without getting into the gory details, this function does two things:

1. It casts `*Simple` to a `*MessageState` which implements the reflective interface `Message`.
1. It stores some static descriptor data into `atomicMessageInfo` if it has not been stored already.

With this critical piece of information in mind, lets look at an example of reflection in action:

```go
func TestReflection(t *testing.T) {
	s := proto3.Simple{SimpleBool: true}
	r := s.ProtoReflect()
	v := r.Get(r.Descriptor().Fields().ByName("simple_bool")).Bool()
	if v != s.SimpleBool {
		t.Errorf("field simple_bool = %v, want %v", v, s.SimpleBool)
	}
}
```

Everything up through the call to `ProtoReflect` so far is clear, but its only the tip of the
iceberg. I know how the descriptor information, `MessageInfo`, could be accessed through the
`atomicMessageInfo` pointer. But, how does a generic type like `MessageState` magically access
something concrete like `s.SimpleBool` by using its descriptor? 

The process is complicated so lets do a little backtracking. What and where is this
descriptor? Within the generated Go code, looking very conspicuous, is an array of byes:

```go
var file_simple_proto_rawDesc = []byte{
	0x0a, 0x0c, 0x73, 0x69, 0x6d, 0x70, 0x6c, 0x65, 0x2e, 0x70, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x74, 0x6f, 0x12, 0x13,
	//...
}
```

`file_simple_proto_rawDesc` is a serialized `FileDescriptorProto` containing all the static
information for `Simple`. These byes get lazily unmarshalled in various stages as needed during
runtime. For example, calling `Message::Descriptor` initializes less static data than calling
`Message::Get`. In Rust, this is equivalent to wrapping the fields and nested fields in
`MessageInfo` with [`sync::OnceCell<T>`]. 

Speaking of which, lets take a look at the fields in `MessageInfo`. For the purpose of explanation,
some liberties were taken to simplify the code.

```go
type MessageInfo struct {
	Desc         pref.MessageDescriptor
	fields       map[pref.FieldNumber]*fieldInfo
	extensionMap func(pointer) *map[pref.FieldNumber]ExtensionField
	coderFields  map[pref.FieldNumber]*coderFieldInfo
}

type fieldInfo struct {
	fieldDesc pref.FieldDescriptor
	has       func(pointer) bool
	clear     func(pointer)
	get       func(pointer) pref.Value
	set       func(pointer, pref.Value)
}

type coderFieldInfo struct {
	funcs      pointerCoderFuncs
	mi         *MessageInfo      // non-null when field is of type Message
	num        pref.FieldNumber  // unique to each message
	offset     offset            // offset in bytes from beginning of struct
}

type pointerCoderFuncs struct {
	size      func(p pointer, f *coderFieldInfo) int
	marshal   func(b []byte, p pointer, f *coderFieldInfo) ([]byte, error)
	unmarshal func(b []byte, p pointer, wtyp protowire.Type, f *coderFieldInfo) error
}
```

`MessageInfo` and `fieldInfo` contain their unmarshalled descriptor data, but, the other fields are
more interesting. The function objects take a `pointer` which, as you may have guessed, is
`*MessageState` with or without an offset applied, depending on the function. By indexing some
[`Offset`] into `*MessageState` and casting the data to a [`Value`], the reflective interface is
able to access and modify a concrete message's data, like it did for `Simple` in the test above. To
me this all sounded somewhat nuts, especially for generated code. Go, however, has powerful
reflection capabilities built into the language, so this practice becomes somewhat reasonable.

### But what about Rust? A glance at `Pin`

Back to rust. For the moment, lets forget about serde. How should reflection be implemented?

A Rust analog to the implementation above would involve gratuitous amounts of [`mem::transmute`].
Just a brief glance at the documentation or the [`nomicon`] and I am feeling just a smidge
uncomfortable. Rust doesn't have the same reflective capabilities as Go, so it truly feels like
casting off into a sea of bytes and praying for correctness. The point of this project is to learn
and Rust seems to be telling me to find another way. Lets take the hint.

How about making our own type like `MessageState` - lets call it `Reflection` - that holds a
reference to the other data in the struct. `Reflection` would also contain references to generated
descriptor data, but lets leave that out for now. To reflect, just return `reflect`, a field that
all generated protobuf messages could have in common.


```rust
// Imagine this contains a reference to static descriptor info too.
pub struct Reflection<'a> {
    pub fields: Vec<Value<'a>>,
}

// Imagine more variants here.
pub enum Value<'a> {
    Bool(&'a bool),
    I32(&'a i32),
}

// A generated message with internal message state for reflection.
pub struct Simple<'a> {
    reflect: Reflection<'a>,
    pub simple_bool: bool,
}
```

Of course, its not quite this easy. References can never be null so its not possible to make a
struct that points to itself like this.

```rust
impl<'a> Simple<'a> {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Simple {
            reflect: Reflection {
                fields: vec![Value::Bool(/* ??? */)],
            },
            simple_bool: false,
        }
    }
}
```

Thankfully there is a type for that and all the cool containers are using it!

```rust
use std::ptr::NonNull;

pub enum Value {
    Bool(NonNull<bool>),
    I32(NonNull<i32>),
}

impl Simple {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut s = Simple {
            reflect: Reflection {
                fields: vec![Value::Bool(NonNull::dangling())],
            },
            simple_bool: false,
        };
        s.reflect.fields[0] = Value::Bool(NonNull::from(&s.simple_bool));
        s
    }
    
    pub fn reflect(&self) -> &Reflection {
        &self.reflect
    }

    pub fn reflect_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Reflection {
        &mut self.reflect
    }
}

```

Its very nice how the lifetime went away too. Borrowing `reflect`, which is bound to the lifetime of
the object holding it, will always be good enough. Okay, so this code is little clever, but it
compiles! Does it work? Nope! Check out this test:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    let s = Simple::new();
    
    // If it wasn't for return value optimization, this would already be 
    // unsound, but lets explicitly force a move to prove a point.
    let s = s;

    let v = match s.reflect().fields.get(0) {
        Some(Value::Bool(v)) => v,
        _ => unreachable!(),
    };

    assert_eq!(format!("{:p}", v.as_ptr()), format!("{:p}", &s.simple_bool));
}
```

```
thread 'it_works' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `"0x7fc75c46f578"`,
 right: `"0x7fc75c46f598"`'
```

Coming from C++, one of the nice things about Rust is how transparent moving data feels. I almost
forgot I was doing it... Until this happened. 

Okay so now what? Surely I am not the only one who wants to do this. Soon enough, I found something
called [`pin`]. The documentation even has an example for my use case, something called
self-referential structs. I had never seen anything like `Pin` before, but thanks to [`Boats`],
[`Jon`], and the [`async-book`], I was finally able to wrap my head around it! 

As magical as it is, `Pin` won't actually solve the problem. Yes, its important to use it when
writing self-referential structs, but it's purpose is to turn runtime bugs into compile time errors;
it doesn't prevent moves from happening. I'd say its more of a safety `Pin` (sorry!). 

Ultimately, the problem is much more fundamental. I am using the stack. Things on the stack get
moved and fall out of scope. So, I need to use the heap. Its not immediately obvious, but heap
allocation and `Pin` are a package deal. Rust drops little hints like `Box` having its own
[constructor](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.pin) specifically for
pinning objects to the heap. Also, in the example from the `pin` documentation , the constructor for
the self-referential struct returns a `Pin<Box<Self>>`.

```rust
fn new(data: String) -> Pin<Box<Self>> { /* ... */ }
```

That's not a coincidence; it forces heap allocation. Heap allocated objects are accessed indirectly
through pointers, and those pointers are free to move around all they want. 

By the way, objects may be pinned to the stack, but its incredibly limiting, so the use cases for it
are rare. It took me far too long to accept that.

Unfortunately, heap allocating a type like `Simple` feels a little heavy and users would have to
interact with a `Box` instead of the type directly, all for a feature most will never use. 

As a last gasp, I found another interesting concept called [`rel-ptr`]. This library could be used
in a very similar way to [`Offset`] with no `transmute` necessary. However, concerns have been
raised that the implementation is [unsound](https://github.com/RustyYato/rel-ptr/issues/3). I think
I would want support from the language for something like that anyway. Lets keep searching for
alternatives.

### Type conversion: heavy and light

How about something a little more conventional? Lets make a conversion trait, much like [`From`], but
fancier.

```rust
pub trait Reflect: Sized {
    fn reflect(self) -> Reflection<Self>;
}

pub struct Reflection<T> {
    message: Message,
    _marker: PhantomData<T>,
}

pub struct Message {
    fields: Vec<Option<Value>>,
}
```

Damn, that's fancy. Whats that [`PhantomData`]? When a type is generic over type parameter `T`, the
compiler rightfully gets mad if the type doesn't actually use a `T`. However, there are some use
cases where keeping that information around is important. `Reflection` uses it to track which
concrete message type to go back to, via `absorb`, the opposite of `reflect`.

```rust
impl<T> Reflection<T> {
    pub fn absorb(self) -> Result<T, ReflectionError>
    where
        Message: TryInto<T, Error = ReflectionError>,
    {
        self.message.try_into()
    }
}

impl<T> Reflect for T
where
    T: Into<Message>,
{
    fn reflect(self) -> Reflection<Self> {
        Reflection::new(self)
    }
}
```

Assuming `Simple` can be converted to/from a `Message`, reflection looks like:

```rust
let s: Simple = Simple::new();
let r: Reflection<Simple> = s.reflect();
let s: Simple = r.absorb().unwrap();
```

ell that's left is to implement the actual conversion. As you may have guessed from the section
title, I found two type conversion candidates to compare: heavy and light.

Before getting into it, lets flex the protobuf type system a little more by making a new message 
`Complex`.

```protobuf
syntax = "proto2";

message Complex {
  optional Enum optional_enum = 1;
  repeated bytes repeated_bytes = 2;
  map<int32, Nested> map_message = 3;

  enum Enum { 
    ZERO = 0;
    ONE = 1;
    TEN = 10;
  }

  message Nested {
    optional string optional_string = 1;
  }
}
``` 

Lets also fully flesh out `Value`, but this time without the references.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub enum Value {
    Bool(bool),
    Bytes(Vec<u8>),
    Enum(Enum),
    F32(f32),
    F64(f64),
    I32(i32),
    I64(i64),
    Message(Message),
    String(String),
    U32(u32),
    U64(u64),
    List(Vec<Value>),
    Map(HashMap<Value, Value>),
}
```

This design won't go out of its way to prevent invalid types around `List` and `Map`. For example,
its possible to create a list of maps, which isn't definable in protobuf syntax. Also its really
nice when the template type parameters of `List` and `Map` because the per element conversion
to/from a `Value` is no longer necessary. Here is a definition that utilizes the type system better:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum Value {
    Bool(Rule<bool>),
    Bytes(Rule<Vec<u8>>),
    Enum(Rule<Enum>),
    F32(Rule<f32>),
    F64(Rule<f64>),
    I32(Rule<i32>),
    I64(Rule<i64>),
    Message(Rule<Message>),
    String(Rule<String>),
    U32(Rule<u32>),
    U64(Rule<u64>),
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum Rule<T> {
    Singular(T),
    Repeated(Vec<T>),
    Map(Key<T>),
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum Key<T> {
    Bool(HashMap<bool, T>),
    I32(HashMap<i32, T>),
    I64(HashMap<i64, T>),
    String(HashMap<String, T>),
    U32(HashMap<u32, T>),
    U64(HashMap<u64, T>),
}
```

Granted, `Value` becomes less intuitive, but lets give it a try. Note, it is still possible for
`absorb` to fail. For example, `Enum` values may not match a valid variant or the `field`s in
`Message` may not match the descriptor. This is why `absorb` returns a `Result`. Without further
ado, on to conversion.

#### The heavy conversion

This is the most direct approach. Compiling our protobuf messages would produce rust structs that
look like:

```rust
pub struct Simple {
    pub simple_bool: bool,
}

pub struct Complex {
    pub optional_enum: Option<ComplexEnum>,
    pub repeated_bytes: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    pub map_message: HashMap<i32, ComplexNested>,
}

pub enum ComplexEnum {
    One = 1,
    Two = 2,
    Ten = 10,
}

pub struct ComplexNested {
    pub optional_string: Option<String>,
}
```

Each struct has fields that are intuitive enough to be made public; this wont be the case for the
light conversion. But as a trade-off, the fields are need to be fully processed to produce a
`Reflection`. 

```rust

impl From<Complex> for Message {
    fn from(m: Complex) -> Self {
        Message {
            fields: vec![
                m.optional_enum
                    .map(|v| Value::Enum(Rule::Singular(Enum { number: v as i32 }))),
                Some(Value::Bytes(Rule::Repeated(m.repeated_bytes))),
                Some(Value::Message(Rule::Map(Key::I32(
                    m.map_message
                        .into_iter()
                        .map(|(k, v)| (k, v.into()))
                        .collect(),
                )))),
            ],
        }
    }
}

impl TryFrom<Message> for Complex {
    type Error = AbsorbError;

    fn try_from(m: Message) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let mut fields = m.fields.into_iter();
        if fields.len() != 3 {
            return Err(AbsorbError::invalid_length(3, fields.len()));
        }

        Ok(Complex {
            optional_enum: fields
                .next()
                .unwrap()
                .map(|v| match v {
                    Value::Enum(Rule::Singular(v)) => ComplexEnum::new(v.number)
                        .ok_or_else(|| AbsorbError::invalid_enum("ComplexEnum", &v)),
                    v => Err(AbsorbError::invalid_type("optional_enum", &v)),
                })
                .transpose()?,
            repeated_bytes: match fields.next().unwrap() {
                Some(Value::Bytes(Rule::Repeated(v))) => Ok(v),
                Some(v) => Err(AbsorbError::invalid_type("repeated_bytes", &v)),
                None => Err(AbsorbError::not_optional("repeated_bytes")),
            }?,
            map_message: match fields.next().unwrap() {
                Some(Value::Message(Rule::Map(Key::I32(v)))) => {
                    v.into_iter().map(|(k, v)| Ok((k, v.try_into()?))).collect()
                }
                Some(v) => Err(AbsorbError::invalid_type("map_message", &v)),
                None => Err(AbsorbError::not_optional("map_message")),
            }?,
        })
    }
}
```

Heavy indeed, but iterators and match syntax are really pulling weight. `AbsorbError` is a
[`thiserror`] enum with constructors to make the code a little cleaner.

#### The light conversion

A lighter approach to conversion would be to compile each concrete message into a struct with a
single private `Message` field. Fields are accessed through special access methods that can
perform the conversion between `Value`s in a message.

In true rust fashion, each field has a mut and non-mut assessor method.

- `field(&self) -> &Field`
- `field_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Field`

For messages defined with "proto2" syntax, each field has a couple additional methods for dealing
with nullability:

- `has_field(&self) -> bool`
- `clear_field(&mut self)`

Here would be the part where I show you a clean, simple conversion. Except, there still needs to be
validation. That's a problem because messages and enums require a costly conversion just to
be validated and subsequently be discarded. Take for example, the `map_message` field:

```rust
match &m.fields[2].get_or_insert(Value::Message(Rule::Map(Key::I32(HashMap::new())))) {
    Value::Message(Rule::Map(Key::I32(v))) => v
        .values()
        .map(|v| ComplexNested::try_from(v.clone()))
        .collect::<Result<_, _>>(),
    v => return Err(AbsorbError::invalid_type("map_message", v)),
};
```

To avoid the `clone`, messages could implement an additional [`AsRef`] conversion, but the
documentation does not recommend using it for conversions that are costly or can fail. Ultimately, the
message just needs to be validated, so lets make a `validate` method that takes a reference to a
`Message` and spits out an `AbsorbError` if something is wrong.

```rust
#[repr(transparent)]
pub struct Complex {
    inner: Message,
}

impl Complex {
    fn validate(m: &Message) -> Option<AbsorbError> {
        if m.fields.len() != 3 {
            return Some(AbsorbError::invalid_length(3, m.fields.len()));
        }

        match &m.fields[0] {
            Some(Value::Enum(Rule::Singular(v))) => ComplexEnum::validate(v),
            Some(v) => Some(AbsorbError::invalid_type("optional_enum", v)),
            None => None,
        }?;

        match &m.fields[1] {
            Some(Value::Bytes(Rule::Repeated(_))) => None,
            Some(v) => Some(AbsorbError::invalid_type("repeated_bytes", v)),
            None => Some(AbsorbError::not_optional("repeated_bytes")),
        }?;

        match &m.fields[2] {
            Some(Value::Message(Rule::Map(Key::I32(v)))) => {
                v.values().find_map(ComplexNested::validate)
            }
            Some(v) => Some(AbsorbError::invalid_type("map_message", v)),
            None => Some(AbsorbError::not_optional("map_message")),
        }
    }
}

impl TryFrom<Message> for Complex {
    type Error = AbsorbError;

    fn try_from(m: Message) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        if let Some(err) = Self::validate(&m) {
            return Err(err);
        }

        Ok(Complex { inner: m })
    }
}

All that's left is to make access methods. This is mostly just a ton of boiler plate, with the
exception of `Message` and `Enum` fields which need to be represented as concrete types.

```rust
#[repr(transparent)]
pub struct Complex {
    inner: Message,
}

#[repr(i32)]
pub enum ComplexEnum {
    One = 1,
    Two = 2,
    Ten = 10,
}

#[repr(transparent)]
pub struct Enum {
    pub number: i32,
}

impl Complex {
    pub fn optional_enum(&self) -> ComplexEnum {
        match &self.inner.fields[0] {
            Some(Value::Enum(Rule::Singular(v))) => unsafe {
                // Safety: ComplexEnum is repr(i32) and
                // Enum is a repr(transparent) wrapper around i32
                *(v as *const Enum as *const ComplexEnum)
            },
            Some(_) => unreachable!(),
            None => ComplexEnum::default(),
        }
    }

    pub fn map_message(&self) -> &HashMap<i32, ComplexNested> {
        match &self.inner.fields[2] {
            Some(Value::Message(Rule::Map(Key::I32(v)))) => unsafe {
                // Safety: ComplexNested is a repr(transparent) wrapper around a Message
                &*(v as *const HashMap<i32, Message> as *const HashMap<i32, ComplexNested>)
            },
            _ => unreachable!(),
        }
    }

}
```

Yep, `unsafe`! As noted in the comment, rust has some ability to control the layout of types. Here,
concrete `Messages` and `Enums` are [`newtype`]s that can take advantage of `repr(transparent)`.
This will guarantee the newtype and the type it wraps have the same representation. Therefore, this
bit of unsafe is sound. In fact, David Tolnay, a person much smarter than myself, has a crate for
that called [`ref-cast`]. 

#### Comparing heavy and light

And now for the rusults! To benchmark, I used [`criterion`]. I wont go into detail about the
implementation of the benchmark because its fairly dry and the criterion API is quite simple. Feel
free to take a look at the benches here. I split the benchmarks into groups so that heavy and light
implementations can be side-by-side compared based on 5 categories, per message:

- `new`: Construct a default concrete message.
- `access`: Access all the fields of the message without mutation.
- `mutate`: Mutate all the fields of the message.
- `reflect`: Reflect a non-empty message. See implementation for more details.
- `absorb`: Absorb a reflection of a non-empty message. See implementation for more details.

test simple/absorb/light ... bench:          21 ns/iter (+/- 1)
```

It comes as no surprise that there is no clear winner here. It'a trade-off between `new`, `access`,
`mutate` and `reflect`, `absorb`. Light makes the reflection API seemingly constant-time with
impressive performance gains, especially for messages with increasingly large amounts of data. But,
oof! It really does pay for it by adding non-trivial overhead to what I anticipate to be the far
more commonly used methods.
